When building up your real estate business, your sphere of influence (or SOI) should always be a focal point. But what is an SOI? Simply put, your sphere of influence is who you know.&nbsp;

**Whether it be friends, family members, acquaintances, or anyone else, your SOI is made up of the people in your life who already know, like, and trust you.** In other words, this group of individuals is the perfect starting point for growing your real estate business.&nbsp;

Chances are high that at least one of the people in your SOI is looking to buy or sell, or knows someone who is. This is good news for you, as repeat and referral business is the easiest lead source out there. Acquiring new business is a lot more difficult and a lot more expensive than leveraging leads from your existing relationships.&nbsp;

So how, and how often, should you reach out to your SOI? Studies show that the people in your sphere will forget about the service you offer every 16 days. **To stay top-of-mind, you need to establish a system that will allow you to reach out in some way at least once every two weeks.**&nbsp;

It doesnâ€™t always have to be a phone call, though. Texts, video messages, emails, client events, and one-on-one lunches are all methods we at BlueFuse Realty use to stay in touch with our database, and they can work for you and your business, too.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
