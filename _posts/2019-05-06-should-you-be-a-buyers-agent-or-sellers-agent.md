When we’re speaking with soon-to-be agents, many of them wonder, **“Should I be a buyer’s agent or a seller’s agent?”&nbsp;**

Some agents, for example, take on a range of responsibilities and wear many hats in the process. They might work with both buyers and sellers in accounting and in lead generation, which can make for a pretty convoluted juggling act. Not to mention the fact that it becomes difficult to have an expert grasp of any one area.&nbsp;

In response to this, a lot of agents are beginning to develop specialized skills and roles—particularly once they’re in a team environment. **One cardinal benefit of joining a team is that agents can swim in their own lanes and excel in a single facet of the business.&nbsp;**

Let’s take a closer look at the roles of both a buyer’s agent and a seller’s agent.&nbsp;

With respect to the buyer’s agent, we often look for specific kinds of personalities. One of the leading indicators for whether or not someone is a fit for this role is the DISC profile. We’ve learned that **someone with a high “I” personality is a natural fit for becoming a buyer’s agent.&nbsp;**

People that possess this personality are influential, socially adept, and relationship-focused. They enjoy building relationships, seeing beautiful homes, and playing an active part in buyers achieving their real estate dreams.&nbsp;

Those who make great listing agents, on the other hand, typically have more experience under their belt. They understand the complexities of listing a home and the negotiations that take place because they’ve put all of this into practice.&nbsp;

Marketing a home is a highly specialized skill, so any listing agent should be well-trained and tenured in their craft.&nbsp;

As for their personality profile, **listing agents tend to fall within the “D” category**—someone who’s a driven, action-oriented, and decisive. A good listing agent will move quickly and with purpose in order to help their client capture the highest sale price on their home.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about pursuing a career in real estate and you’re curious which of the two you’d be a better fit for, please get in touch with us. We’d love to have that conversation with you\!&nbsp;
