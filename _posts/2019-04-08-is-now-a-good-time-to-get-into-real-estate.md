People love to ask us about beginning a career in real estate, usually starting with the question, “Is now a good time to get into real estate?”

To provide a definitive answer to that question, we need to ask three of our own:&nbsp;

**1. What’s going on in the market?** Our market has been very strong for several years now. There are many reasons for this, but one of the biggest influencing factors is that so many employers are moving into the area. As more and more people move here, the number of homebuyers increases, keeping the demand for real estate high.

<br>**2. Will the current trends continue?** Of course, we don’t have a crystal ball to say for sure, but we can say that because employers continue to find our area so attractive, our market is likely to continue being stable. Prices and values may not continue to increase in the same way that they have been over the past couple of years, but they will rise at a slower, more stable rate.&nbsp;

<br>**3. What makes for a stable real estate career?** If you’re looking for a stable career in real estate, you’ll want a steady income—not one that comes and goes, but rather a sustainable income you can plan on. But how do you get a sustainable income in real estate? The secret is great, repeatable lead generation systems. It’s not just about being able to generate a lead; you need to have the systems, tools, and training to be able to generate them consistently and to follow up with them. Really, success in real estate hinges on follow-ups, building relationships, and communication. If you have those systems, you can build a long-term, lucrative, and sustainable career.
