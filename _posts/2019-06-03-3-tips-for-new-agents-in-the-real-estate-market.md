If you’re beginning your career in real estate or are considering making the jump to begin one, there are a few tips that we can give you to help your career get off to a great start.

**1\. Begin with the end in mind.** By that, I mean you need to think about what you want to get out of real estate—do you want to sell homes until your 107 years old, or do you want to exit the industry before then? You need to work with a company that has a variety of ways to create a retirement plan so you can get out of the business when the time is right for you. That’s why we work with eXp—they have a great retirement plan that many companies lack.

<br>**2\. Know that real estate is a relationship-driven business.** It’s all about who you know. Keep track of all the people you know, including those in your phone contacts, your Facebook friends, people you’re connected with on LinkedIn, and all the various social media platforms you’re connected to. Figure out how many people you know, and also think about what you can do to expand your sphere of influence.

<br>**3\. Work with a great team.** Begin your career by working with a team that has plans to develop and train you, teach you how to grow your business, and coach you on how best to serve the people you already know.
