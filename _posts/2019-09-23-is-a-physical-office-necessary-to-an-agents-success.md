{% include youtube.html %}&nbsp;*Do you need a physical office to be a successful agent? No, but there are still benefits to having one.&nbsp;*

Is a physical office necessary to an agent’s success? Not anymore. There are newer brokerage models out there (eXp, for instance) where the entire agent base is virtual. We even recently moderated a training session where we were able to speak to 500 agents across the country. We also have a partnership with Regis that allows us to use office space around the country. That being said, there are benefits (especially when it comes to accountability) to having a physical space where you and other agents can meet. If you’re building a team, you may want the opportunity to have a brick-and-mortar office. At the end of the day, the decision is up to you. If you have any more questions about this or any other topic don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.&nbsp;
