At BlueFuse Realty, we’re always thinking about the real estate market, and it’s hard to imagine the future of the market without also thinking about the future of the individual agent. Market “disruptors” are popping up everywhere as of late, from the iBuyer to Zillow to Redfin to even Amazon, who might now enter the arena.&nbsp;

This begs the question: **What’s going to happen to the individual agent?&nbsp;**

Part of what makes real estate such an interesting business is the way in which we utilize technology to market home listings, locate new clients, and more. Be that as it may, **real estate is still very much a relationship-based business.** Because of that, our primary mission, as agents, is to build relationships with future clients. &nbsp;

Some homebuyers would like to move quickly through the process, which makes them good candidates for an iBuyer. However, so many other buyers are seeking an agent who will be with them every step of the way and who can offer sage advice when it comes to buying or selling a home.&nbsp;

For a large percentage of buyers and sellers, this will be the biggest financial decision of their lives. Given that fact, it bears repeating that people want the proper guidance and advice in the decision-making process—especially in the higher price ranges. After all, one seemingly small mistake could cost a buyer thousands of dollars.&nbsp;

As these disruptors increasingly become bigger players in our market landscape, less active, professionally-oriented agents are likely to be bumped from the industry. **Agents who are working day in and day out on their relationships with clients and bringing top-notch service to the table, though, have a great opportunity to succeed.&nbsp;**

For the individual agent, it’s about being wholly invested in your certifications, expertise, and, most of all, your clients.&nbsp;
