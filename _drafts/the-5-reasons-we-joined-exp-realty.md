Why did the BlueFuse Realty Group join with eXp Realty?

The answer starts with relationships. We had a relationship with someone who suggested the idea, so we scheduled a meeting with eXp Realty. We were comfortable where we were at and we were doing well, but once we heard their message and the opportunity was presented, we couldn’t pass it up.&nbsp;

There were five reasons, in particular, that convinced us that this was the best path for us to take. **For your convenience, we’ve provided timestamps of the video above where we list each reason and go into detail about how it benefits us and our clients:&nbsp;**

1:44—Improved technology&nbsp;<br>6:40—A firm retirement plan<br>8:35—Better stock options<br>10:36—When you close a transaction, you can purchase up to 5% of the stock at a 20% discount<br>12:07—The Icon program<br>13:45—Bonus reason: revenue sharing&nbsp;

From here on out, we’re all owners of eXp Realty. People are excited to be here, and the energy, culture, and collaboration are all better than we ever could’ve imagined.&nbsp;

If you’d like to hear more about why we joined eXp Realty or you have any real estate questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
