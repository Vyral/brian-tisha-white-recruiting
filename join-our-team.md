<p>Dear agents in our market who are doing 6-12 deals per year….</p>

<p>If you’re looking to take your career to the next level, continue reading.</p>

<p>The challenge is – and we see this – you may not be earning the money you need or want in real estate. The biggest pain in this business is generating the leads and converting them effectively. You may be struggling to keep focus and stay on task to grow your own business.</p>

<p>I think we all know this, but 90% of all new agents don’t make it three years in the business. According to National Association of Realtors, the average agent does roughly five deals per year. We also have a lot of discounters coming into our market that are taking away from your commission.</p>

<p>You’ll see a lot of agents cold calling prospects and using the same scripts as everyone else to try to get more business. You’ll also see companies promising you leads and “training” to make you successful, but they often don’t follow through on it.</p>

<p>You need to pay your bills, provide for your family, and live the lifestyle of freedom you wanted in the first place by getting into this business. You don’t feel confident in your business and don’t have a support team. You also don’t want a second job and have to live check to check to keep your real estate dream alive. You feel like your running on the treadmill where you don’t build wealth, you just make money to pay your bills.</p>

<p>If you don’t fix this, you won’t make it past the three-year hurdle in real estate. The stress will get to you and you’ll be out of business and have to go get a regular job instead of reaching your full potential.</p>

<p>We are Brian and Tisha White. We’ve been a team for three years and have grown to be in the top 1% of Realtors in North Texas. We know how to perform at a really high level and we can get there quickly and help you too! We understand the problems and can use our past experiences to help you. It’s an extremely difficult business to succeed in alone.</p>

<p>We’d like you to come work here for us and we will work with you on a one-on-one basis. You will get hands-on training and access to our state-of-the-art CRM. We will also help you stay on the cutting edge of trends. We not only help our clients purchase homes, but we also have experience in investment properties as well as buying and flipping homes. We’d love to help you build your wealth.</p>

<p>We are with ExP Realty, a virtual brokerage that offers some of the best training in the world no matter where you are.</p>

<p>You’re going to get access to our CRM and go through one of the best on-boarding program in the industry. I’ll hold you accountable so you stay on track. I have all the systems planned out for you on how to run an efficient business. Finally, you’ll be provided with leads and we will teach you how to generate your own. You’ll also have a support staff to help you with the details so you can serve your client at a high level and don’t have to sit doing paperwork.</p>

<p>This means….</p>

<p>This works if you commit to it. You’ll get the freedom, money and consistency you so desperately desire.</p>

<p>Now you may be looking at other options to sell more real estate:</p>

<p>You can go the hard route and be a solo agent and go through it alone.</p>

<p>You could join another team where you have to get your own business and don’t have a support staff.</p>

<p>There are brokerages out there where all you can do is sell real estate and there are no income streams outside of selling and buying real estate.</p>

<p>I’d like you to come work here. You’ll be on a 50/50 split with an $8,000 cap. That means you pay me 50% of what you bring in to cover my expenses for your support that I take the risk on for you, and then you keep 100% of your money after you pay in $8,000.</p>

<p>So, let’s say we do this. Here’s what’s going to happen. The very first thing we’re going to do is go to happy hour and celebrate because this can change your life. Here’s the plan: For the first 90 days, you’re going to be immersed in our onboarding system. Our goal is to get you into production as fast as possible and get you one to two deals in the first 90 days.</p>

<p>I’m so confident this is going to work that if you follow our system and, for any reason, you don’t make $75,000 in your first year, we’ll make up the difference.</p>

<p>I ask you to reach out to us right now. If you don’t have your business system in place, you will get crushed. Let’s get on this now and make sure we build a moat around your mindset, skills, and most important database so you can know for certain you will succeed in real estate no matter what comes your way. I am here to help you. Let’s do this.</p>

<p>Brian & Tisha</p>
